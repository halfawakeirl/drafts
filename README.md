# Drafts

Drafts is an anonymous website for sharing messages that were never sent, along with lingering thoughts connected to them.

The platform removes likes, comments, and profiles, replacing them with a simple “I relate” interaction to reduce pressure and comparison.

This repository contains a front-end prototype built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
